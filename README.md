# REPM - Registry Package Manager 

REPM is first Package Manager for AOS with a goal of better code reusability. 

# Overview

## Features

- Verify installation - `ToDo`

# Available Commands

# Future Plans

- Rewrite in Rust once there are AOS / Arweave SDKs for it.
- Private packages (still stored on arweave but in encrypted form so that only deployer can decrypt them. Might also be useful for alpha/beta version of packages before main public release).
- Better reputation system with nicer UI and option to flag malicious packages, potentially also frontend blacklist for these packages.
